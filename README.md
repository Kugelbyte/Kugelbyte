### 👾 My Journey into Cybersecurity

It all began with childhood curiosity. I used to wonder — _how do people get 9999 coins in Temple Run?_ or _infinite health in games?_  
Back then, it felt like magic. Today, I know it's code — logic, flaws, and the thrill of finding them.

That curiosity turned into obsession. Hacking wasn't just about breaking into things, it became about understanding systems inside out. Now, I'm channeling that energy into **ethical hacking**, **CTFs**, and **security research** — to learn, break, build, and secure.

### 🔭 What I'm Up To

- 🎯 Sharpening my skills in **Web Application Security**, **CTFs**, and **Bug Bounties**
- ✍️ Writing beginner-friendly documentation (like my [SQLi guide](https://github.com/Kugelbyte/Hack-Log/blob/main/writeups/web/Understanding%20SQL%20Injection%20Payloads.pdf))
- 🧠 Always learning — by doing, failing, trying again
